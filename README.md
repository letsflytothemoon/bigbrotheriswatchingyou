need to add path to boost include files in projects (both) settings before build.

*listenport* in serverconfig.json must be the same as *serverport* in clientconfig.json

*clientport* in serverconfig.json must be the same as *listenport* in clientconfig.json

after launch server just type in web-browser http://*serveraddress*:*port*

client usage:
clent --install
add client to autostart
client --remove
uninstals client
